## Electronics

### Level 1: Sparky
*Terminology*

##### Voltage
```
SI Symbol: E
SI Unit  : Volt ( V )
```
>"Electromotive Force"
- Measure of Potential Energy
- A Measure of energy difference
- Determines how much work each electron can do.
> How hard can each electron push?

##### Current
```
SI Symbol: I
SI Unit  : Ampere ( A )
```
- A measure of the amount of electrons passing a given point
- Determines 
> How many electrons are there?

##### Power
```
SI Symbol: P
SI Unit  : Watt ( W )
```
>"Electromotive Force"
- "Electrical Pressure"
- Easy to measure

- Ohm's Law

Voltage = Resistance * Amperage 

- Watt's Power Law

Watt = Amp *
